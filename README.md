# MRI-ICE-snippets
> CEA NeuroSpin, MR methodological group

This is a collection of Siemens ICE reconstruction tools. Based on several years of ICE programming experience, the idea of this repo is to share some ICE source codes.

## List of ICE projects

- [IceSITF](https://github.com/FranckMauconduit/MRI-ICE-snippets/blob/main/IceSITF/README.md): the ICE functor 'Save Images To File' will save all reconstructed images into a file that can be easily opened within Matlab.

- [IceExplorer](https://github.com/FranckMauconduit/MRI-ICE-snippets/blob/main/IceExplorer/README.md): the ICE functor 'IceExplorer' helps to explorer the ICE pipeline by positioning a functor into the chain. This functor can be used to turn on/off different logs that help to analyze the data passing between functors.

- [IceExtendedFunctor](https://github.com/FranckMauconduit/MRI-ICE-snippets/blob/main/IceExtendedFunctor/README.md): the ICE extended functor implements common functionalities such as saving/retrieving images into/from PDS in order to facilitate some ICE developments.
